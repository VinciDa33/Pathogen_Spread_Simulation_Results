# Pathogen_Spread_Simulation_Results
Results of simulations done for student paper 'Exploration of the Spread of Pathogens Using AI Agents'

Folder format: (identifier) - (genome number)\_(number of agents per generation)\_(number of generations)\n
Example: Folder 3, containing data for genome 2, using 50 agents per generation and running for 80 generations would look like; 3 - 2_50_80

Generation logs contains simple data on the best pareto front from each generation in that simulation

Data logs contains data on the best death fitness agent, the best happiness agent and an agent in between. All taken from the final best pareto front.
